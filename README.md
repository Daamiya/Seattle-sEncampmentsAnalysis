# Seattle'sEncampmentsAnalysis
I’ve been working on analyzing the City of Seattle's encampments data spanning 7 years from 2017 to 2024, which was initially provided in PDF format. After dedicated volunteers entered the data into the database, I took on the task of understanding, cleaning, and standardizing the data in addition to handling outliers, removing duplicates, and handling missing values to prep it for analysis and finally made a comprehensive dashboard featuring:

📅 Yearly sweeps conducted
📊 Monthly sweeps vs. tents removed
📍 Top 10 sweep locations
🏠 Homeless population insights
🔄 Comparisons of tents removed vs. sweeps
📈 Yearly and monthly sweep trends

The dashboard also includes slicers for specific year and month views, offering deeper insights into the data trends.
